If MODBUS is selected as the protocol type, the selected start address must be selected differently from the block addresses used in Mikrodiagram. (Variable addresses in Mikrodiagram, word: 4000, binary: 1000, analog: 6000, long: 8000).

* Line Label

<center>

![mikrodiagram-editor-99](/img/mikrodiagram-editor-99.png)

</center>

Block selection is made, defined in  the variable address table.

In Mikrodiagram should be defined "line definition" to blocks to be transferred to the variable address tab.

* Point Count

<center>

![mikrodiagram-editor-100](/img/mikrodiagram-editor-100.png)

</center>

The number of addresses to be identified from the starting address added to the variable address table is determined. If table blocks are added to the variable address table, the number of points to be read according to the size of the table is automatically defined. (If the starting address is 10000 and the dot number is 4, the defined addresses are 10000, 10001, 10002 and 10003.)

* Protocol Type

</center>

In DNP3, IEC 101, IEC104 protocols, the data added to the variable address table at specific time intervals are used  to sending to client of the datas. For example, if a trigger is detected for 10 seconds on the side of the IEC slave block and the defined block in the variable address table is "send on trigger"; The block value is sent to the client at intervals of 10 seconds.

* Send Method/Change Value

<center>

![mikrodiagram-editor-107](/img/mikrodiagram-editor-107.png)

</center>

In DNP3, IEC101, IEC104 protocols, the block values defined in the variable address table are used sending to client  the when the change exceeds the specified value according to the determined change method. For example, if the sending method is "change level" and the change value is 4, then the value client is sent if the difference between the first value and the value to be sent is greater than 4. (If the first value is 15 and the last value is less than 11 or greater than 19, is sent.

</center>

In the sample; RTD block value in which the ambient temperature value is read is defined in the variable address table by the IEC104 protocol. In the variable address table, the address of the address is 12000 and the client will be sent when the temperature value changes by more than 1 ° C (as the value changes). "Send on trigger" is selected in the variable address table, but it is not active because the "Ttk" input of IEC104 slave block is left empty.

<center>

![mikrodiagram-editor-111](/img/mikrodiagram-editor-111.png)

</center>

In the sample; The analog input block values are printed in an analog table at the top and read from the address 11000 defined in the variable address table with 5 modbus protocol from the address. If the size of the analog table block is 20 bytes and 1 analog value is 4 bytes, 5 analog values are recorded in the table. Since the tabloda has 5 analogue values, the analogue table is selected as the line tag, so that the data on the tabloda is automatically displayed in the "variable address table" "dot number". The "send on trigger", "sending method" and "exchange value" sections are not active due to the Modbus TCP slave protocol feature.

After the project loading process is completed 100%, click "connection" from the "device configuration", click "restart device" and the project loading process is completed.

## Retentivity Configuration

When designing a PLC application, it is important for the PLC user to understand the different types of memory in the PLC. Three types of memory are used by the Mikrodev PLC; RAM, SRAM and FLASH memory.

SRAM memory can be configured by the PLC user as either retentive memory. SRAM is powered by internal battery when PLC external power is off.

Retentive memory is memory that is configured by the user to maintain values through a power reset. Non--retentive memory is memory that is configured by the PLC user to clear data after a power reset.

The default behaviour of the blocks in Mikrodev PLC is non-retentive. You need to select "Retentive" option to make the block use retentive memory.

* Example: 1

If “Retentive” is not selected, it does not make any difference whether you select “Load Initial Value” or not. 

On Power Reset: The device will load the “Register Initial Value” into the register. 

On Project Upload: The device will load the “Register Initial Value” into the register.

<center>

![mikrodiagram-editor-150](/img/mikrodiagram-editor-150.png)

</center>

* Example: 2

On Power Reset: The register will preserve the latest value. 
On Project Upload:

A-    If there are any changes in the project like adding/removing retentive blocks, the “Register Initial Value” will be written on the register after boot.

B-    If there are minor changes on the project like parameter update or add/remove lines, the register will preserve the latest value after boot 

<center>

![mikrodiagram-editor-151](/img/mikrodiagram-editor-151.png)
